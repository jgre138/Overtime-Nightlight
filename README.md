# Overtime-Nightlight
My Sphero Bolt+ Robot Project done for CS 104 Intro to Problem Solving at Monmouth University

The original idea was to use the robot to guide the user along a set path in the dark using the LED matrix to show signals to the user when its moving and to speak when its beginning to move or it has completed the task. For the final version, there was more to the movement added and more of a reason to the robot guiding a user, as the user needs to go around the room to task spots, where they would do work.

First verision (Nightlight Demo) is testing the fucntions to be used for the final product.
The final (Overtime Nightlight) is having the robot guide a user in the dark around a classroom to do tasks in the dark, as if the person is working a long day.
