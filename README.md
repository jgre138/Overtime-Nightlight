# Overtime-Nightlight
My Sphero Bolt+ Robot Project done for CS 104 Intro to Problem Solving at Monmouth University

The original idea was to use the robot to guide the user along a set path in the dark using the LED matrix to show signals to the user when its moving and to speak when its beginning to move or it has completed the task. For the final version, there was more to the movement added and more of a reason to the robot guiding a user, as the user needs to go around the room to task spots, where they would do work.

First verision (Nightlight Demo) is testing the fucntions to be used for the final product.
The final (Overtime Nightlight) is having the robot guide a user in the dark around a classroom to do tasks in the dark, as if the person is working a long day.

Programmer Goals: (We have 4 weeks left to work on the project - As of 10/30/2025)
- Week 9: Play with the robot and make sure the robot can navigate between the doors
    - Possibly use new button function??
- Week 10: Program path to tasks starting from door A
- Week 11: Program path starting from door B
- Week 12: Program robot going from task to their respective opposite doors

Current progress:
- Coded all of the weeks out, just need to do some testing and debugging on all of it.
- Play around and possibly add a debug mode using some of the other features the robto has to offer (Ex. the ligth sensors and the button functions)
